Category: Forensics
Difficulty: Easy

Description:
The image contains multiple fragments of the flag stored using different data-hiding techniques.
Analyze the file at different layers and reconstruct the complete flag.

Flag:
SECE{F1rstp@rt_S3c0nd_part_3rdp@rt}

Hints:
1. File metadata may contain non-visual information.
2. Human-readable strings can exist inside binary data.
3. Standard forensic or steganography tools may reveal hidden content.

Write-Up:
Step 1:
Inspect the image metadata to identify any embedded textual information.
The first fragment of the flag is stored within the metadata fields.

Step 2:
Analyze the raw file contents to locate readable strings.
The second fragment of the flag appears as a plain string inside the binary data.

Step 3:
Perform steganographic analysis on the image.
Extract the hidden payload to obtain the final fragment of the flag.

Step 4:
Combine all recovered fragments in the correct order to reconstruct the complete flag.
